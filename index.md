# GIRA3D Occupancy Modeling

GIRA3D Occupancy Modeling provides implementations for inferring
occupancy from Gaussian mixture models \[1\]. Python bindings enable
integration into a larger number of projects.

Features of this module include:

* MATLAB and python examples to sample from Gaussian mixture models

* Raytracing code in 3D to update occupancy

* Variable resolution occupancy grid map in C++ with MATLAB
and Python bindings to enable occupancy inference.

* Visualization tools for Python and MATLAB.

* Dataset processing and plotting tools.
